I am a Data Scientist with experience of building solutions to diverse set of problems spanning the field. I consider myself a lifelong learner of mathematics and AI.

I graduated from University of San Francisco [Masters in Data Science](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science) Program recently. In 2017, I graduated from [IIT-BHU](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/).

I worked as a **Data Science Intern** at PG&E building Yolo-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on drone imagery to detect defects in power gridlines.

Before joining my master program, I worked as a **Data Science Consultant** at [Fractal](https://fractal.ai/){:target="_blank"}, where I have built demand forecasting models for Fortune-500 companies and worked on extracting insights out of text data using Natural Language Processing Techniques.
